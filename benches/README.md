# Clorinde Benchmarks
Benchmarking suite for code generation and code execution, heavily based on [the diesel benchmarking suite](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel/tree/master/diesel_bench).

Note that the benchmarks use the `diesel` crate which links directly against `libpq`, so you will need to install it.
On debian-based distros, the package is `libpq-dev`, on RHEl-based distros, it is named `libpq-devel`, and for Arch-based distros, it is included with `postgresql-libs`.

## Running
```bash
cargo bench
```

## Results
These results are from benchmarks run locally on `2025-02-15` and may not reflect production environment performance. See the full Criterion report [here](https://halcyonnouveau.github.io/clorinde/benchmarks/2025-02-15/report).

## Disclaimer
These benchmarks are meant to provide a rough comparison of different approaches in a local development environment. Real-world performance can vary significantly based on many factors including network latency, concurrent access patterns, and specific use cases.
